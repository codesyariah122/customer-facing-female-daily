              </ul>
              <br />
              If your payment was made with a Credit Card, refunds will be made
              automatically to your account during the pre-auth period (or
              before delivery).<br />
              However, if your payment was made using other methods, or if you
              get refunded after products delivered to you, you will be required
              to fill in a refund request form and select any of these available
              refund options:

              <ul class="mt-[26px] mb-[9px] list-disc pl-4">
                <li><strong>Allo Wallet</strong></li>
              </ul>
              This method is highly advisable as it takes only up to 2 working
              days to be added to your account. Your Allo Wallet balance can be
              used to transact in any of CT corp business including FD Studio
              with no expiry date.

              <ul class="mt-[26px] mb-[9px] list-disc pl-4">
                <li><strong>E-voucher</strong></li>
              </ul>
              This method may take up to 3 working days before it’s ready for
              claims. All e-vouchers can only be used for transactions at FD
              Studio web/app only, and will expire within 30 days.

              <ul class="mt-[26px] mb-[9px] list-disc pl-4">
                <li><strong>Original payment method</strong></li>
              </ul>
              This refund method may take up to 45 working days, depending on
              your bank’s policy. If you prefer to get your refund back to your
              bank account, please make sure to check your balance regularly
              once your refund status is confirmed successful.
